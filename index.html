						<h2>Why we write Unit Tests?</h2>
					</section>
				
					<section>
						<h3>Prevent bugs</h3>
						
						<aside class="notes">
							Prevent bugs - Fixing bugs is context switching
							but Unit tests only protect against bugs if the unit tests 
							cover the scenario that cause the bug - myth of 100% coverage</p>
							When you’re refactoring unit’s code but 
							without meaning to change its behaviour. In this case, unit tests can often 
							tell you if the unit’s behaviour has changed.
							Communicate future DEV what not to break!
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Design aid</h3>
	
						<blockquote class="fragment">If I don’t use tests for design, I find myself writing code in a hurry, because I cannot keep all the details that I have in my mind for long. Instead TDD gives myself the pleasure to write code at my pace, with the ease of mind that I don’t risk to forget anything.</blockquote>
						
						<aside class="notes">								
							<p>Design aid - Writing tests first gives you a clearer perspective on the ideal API design. 
								It forces you to have a direction in mind before you start charging into the fray, 
								and having a direction in mind leads to better designs</p>
							<p>TDD is a robust way of designing software components (“units”) 
								interactively so that their behaviour is specified through unit tests.</p>
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Documentation</h3>
	
						<aside class="notes">
							It shows your understanding of a feature.
							Unit tests contain a lot of knowledge about the behaviour of a single unit of code.
							Documentation - The test should provide a clear description of the feature being tested.</p>
						</aside>
					</section>

				<section>
					<h2>How to write Unit Tests?</h2>
					<p class="fragment">Most developers seem to agree that testing is good, but they also frequently disagree about how to test.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Approaches</h3>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Testing state</li>
						<li class="fragment">Testing implementation</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Testing state - involves performing an action on a unit and then checking that 
							either an expected result was returned, or the state of the unit has been 
							updated as expected.</p>
						<p>Testing implementation is an extension to white box testing where you check 
							that certain methods are invoked or not during the execution of an action. 
							Here you don’t assert any state, but instead verify that internal behavior is doing 
							what is expected.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
						<h3>The anatomy of a good test</h3>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Arrange</li>
							<li class="fragment">Act</li>
							<li class="fragment">Assert</li>
						</ul>

						<aside class="notes">
							‘Arrange’ gets everything ready to perform the test. This could be declaring variables, building required objects or setting the state of a unit. For simple unit tests, this step may not be needed.
							‘Act’ performs the action that we are testing on the unit/subject.
							‘Assert’ checks to see that the action performed correctly. We want to check that either the return value of a method call is expected, or the state of an object is as expected.
						</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Guidelines</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Readable</li>
						<li class="fragment">Maintainable</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
							This could be a series of workshops.
							The goal of these guidelines is to make your tests:
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Make each test independent</h3>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Order of test should not matter</p>
						<p>Mock out all external services and state - but mock only those who can couse shared state/side effects</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Don't make unnecessary assertions</h3>

					<aside class="notes">
							<p>Keep the number of assertions per unit test to a minimum. 
									A single unit test should test one thing.</p>
									<p>"have only one logical assertion per test". Remember, unit tests are a design specification of how a certain behaviour should work, not a list of observations of *everything* the code happens to do.</p>		
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Avoid unnecessary preconditions</h3>
					
					<aside class="notes">
						Avoid having common setup code that runs at the beginning of lots of unrelated tests. 
						Otherwise, it's unclear what assumptions each test relies on.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Name your unit tests clearly and consistently</h3>

					<pre class="fragment"><code class="hljs" data-trim>
describe('[subject]', () => {
  describe('when [scenario/context]', () => {
    it('should [expected behaviour/result]', () => {
    });
  });
});
					</code></pre>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Tests names should be concise, explicit, descriptive</p>
						<p>S/S/R - This name describes the **subject** (ProductController's Purchase action), the **scenario** (stock is zero), and the **result** (renders "out of stock" view).</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Avoid logic in your tests</h3>
	
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>avoid loops and if conditionals</p>
						<p>Conditionals: you don't know which path the test will take
								Loops: you could be sharing state between tests</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h3>Consider using factory functions</h3>

					<pre><code class="hljs" data-trim></code></pre>

					<aside class="note">
						<p>Factories can:						
							help reduce the setup code, 
							make each test more readable, 
							provide flexibility when creating new instances (setting an initial state, for example)</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
					
				<section>
					<h3>Assertions should be situated in the unit tests</h3>
					
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Rather that pulled to the separate method - It increases the readability</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Don't comment your tests</h3>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>If they are unclear or complex it's better to remove them</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Know your tools</h3>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>fit, .only, different assertions</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Pay attention to readability of error messages</h3>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Cover the general case and the edge cases</h3>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Minimal and Meaningless data</h3>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>It's common to find unit tests in which the data passed to and expected 
							from the subject appear like it might be special.</p>
							Sometimes we repeat data structure from API
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Keep the test suite consistent</h3>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Specially for teams</p>
						<p>Avoid Accidental Creativity - 
							Interpreting the author's intent when reading a test is  
							unnecessarily challenging when the structure and form of each test varies</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Test should answer 4 questions</h3>

					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">What component aspect are you testing?</li>
						<li class="fragment">What should the feature do?</li>
						<li class="fragment">What is the actual output?</li>
						<li class="fragment">What is the expected output?</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Final thoughts</h1>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Is having any Unit Tests is better than having none?</h3>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>A suite of good unit tests is immensely valuable: it documents your design, 
							and makes it easier to refactor and expand your code while retaining a clear 
							overview of each component’s behaviour. 
							
							However, a suite of bad unit tests is immensely painful: 
							it doesn’t prove anything clearly, and can severely inhibit your 
							ability to refactor or alter your code in any way.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Unit Tests vs Integration/E2E</h3>

					<blockquote>Proving that components X and Y both work independently doesn’t prove that they’re compatible with one another or configured correctly.</blockquote>
